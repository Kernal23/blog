> How can I know what I think until I read what I write?

I started this website in order to learn more about the web, how do you setup, administer and maintain a website? As I *read and write* I hope to use this blogging platform as a place to collect my thoughts on a topic, documenting useful bits of code to save repeating the furious internet search it took to find the answer and I hope enable others to learn too.
