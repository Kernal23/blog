## 1. Signal is a Not-For-Profit 😇
Telegram is not 💰. I want the reassurance that the profit motive isn't there for my communications platform - [because we've seen where that leads to before](../goodbye-whatsapp/#😈-the-faustian-pact).

## 2. Signal's Group chats are limited in size 🗣
Ok this sounds like a reason against Signal - hear me out! Signal's [group chats are limited to a 1000](https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007319331-Group-chats), Telegram's are not. This is important to limit the growth of adverse political groups for [example things like Proud Boys on Telegram 🤦‍♂️](https://t.me/s/proudboysusa) - I'd rather not see another assault on American democracy.

## 3. Signal's Code Is Completely Open Source 🔍
[Here is Signal's code](https://github.com/signalapp) - this is important for scrutiny to occur. Telegram's code is only partially open source. Most importantly, Telegram's server software is not open source, where your valuable messages get sent - how can we trust what we can't see?

## 4. Signals E2E is the best 🥇
Signal's end-to-end encryption protocol is [regarded as best in class](https://www.wired.com/story/signal-encryption-protocol-hacker-lexicon/) and is widely regarded as far superior to Telegram's. The [security industry has heavily criticised Telegram's encryption model](https://security.stackexchange.com/a/49802/115711).

## 5. Signal Protects You By Default 🔒
All of Signal's messages and content are encrypted by default, not the case for Telegram.

## 6. Signal's Growth is Outpacing The Alternatives 📈
In terms of absolute number of users I'd like to say Signal wins. But it's unknown exactly which is larger. Signal doesn't publish its user numbers, maybe because it doesn't have a profit motive to do so. As far as I can see on the app stores I've looked at, [Signal was downloaded more than Telegram](../goodbye-whatsapp/#💬-but-my-network%2Fgroup-chats-are-on-whatsapp). Signal '[ranks at the top on App Store in 40 countries and on Google Play Store in 18 countries](https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/signal-brian-acton-talks-about-exploding-growth-monetization-and-whatsapp-data-sharing-outrage/)'. The pace of download growth is staggering +5,923% - any tech team would struggle to handle that explosion in growth in that amount of time 🤯.

## 7. Signal's Passes Independently Verified ✅
Telegram does not have a great reputation when it comes to independent audits.  In contrast, Signal's protocol has been [inspected by industry experts and given the thumbs-up](https://threatpost.com/signal-audit-reveals-protocol-cryptographically-sound/121892/) 👍.

## 8. Telegram Collects More Of your Data
[Telegram collects more data on you](https://mybroadband.co.za/news/security/382036-whatsapp-vs-signal-vs-telegram-vs-facebook-the-data-apps-collect-about-you.html). Whereas Signal, when under the full force of a [FBI subpoena Signal declared what was happening publicly, and they could only share account creation date](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/10/fbi-demands-signal-user-data-but-theres-not-much-to-hand-over/), because that is all they had.
