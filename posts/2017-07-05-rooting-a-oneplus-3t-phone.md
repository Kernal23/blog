I recently rooted my Oneplus 3T phone on Android 7.1.1. Finding the right information was not as easy as I thought it might be, so here's my summary. I used my macbook, you will need your USB cord to connect the phone. **Warning** - you will end up wiping your phone during this process, I'd recommend performing a backup prior. I didn't as I figured most app data are synced to the cloud, the only things I noticed missing was SMSs and things like numbers and Whatsapp history where a sync to the cloud occurred on a weekly basis.

## 1\. Unlock the [Bootloader](https://www.androidcentral.com/what-is-android-bootloader)

a. If you haven't already done so, you will need to enable `Developer Options` on your phone by tapping 7x on the `Build Number` found in your phone under `Settings > About Phone > Build Number`. Once enabled, navigate to `Settings > Developer Options > USB debugging` and ensure this is toggled to ON.

b. You will now need the to obtain the [Android Software Development Kit to run commands on your phone from your computer terminal](https://dl.google.com/android/android-sdk_r24.4.1-macosx.zip). This provides several tools you will use including [Android Development Bridge (ADB)](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb.html) and [Fastboot](https://www.androidcentral.com/android-z-what-fastboot). Once downloaded, unzip and place the files in a place where you can find them. Then navigate to the folder and launch the Android SDK manager by double clicking on `android-sdk-macosx/tools/android`. This will provide a GUI to install the tools needed as per the following screenshot.

Now you are ready to run some commands:

```bash
# Navigate to the tools
$ cd /android-sdk-macosx/platform-tools
# Check that your phone is connected properly
$ adb devices
List of devices attached
fc031cd8 device

# Reboot phone into bootloader
$ ./adb reboot bootloader
# Unlock the phone
$ ./fastboot oem unlock
```

The last command will wipe your phone. Once complete you will then boot up the phone and need to repeat the process in step 1.a.

## 2\. Install TWRP Custom Recovery

I chose the open source [TWRP recovery software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TWRP). You can get a copy of TWRP [here](http://techerrata.com/browse/twrp2/bacon). Without the installation of TWRP, Step 3 will not be possible (I tried but the OnePlus recovery won't allow you to install SuperSu).

```bash
# Check that your phone is connected properly
$ adb devices
List of devices attached
fc031cd8 device

$ ./fastboot flash recovery /YOUR/PATH/TO/TWRP.img
$ ./fastboot reboot
```

## 3\. Root Via Flashing SuperSU

If you haven't already [download Android File Transfer](https://www.android.com/filetransfer/). Transfer the [SuperSU zip](https://download.chainfire.eu/696/SuperSU/UPDATE-SuperSU-v2.46.zip) into the root of your phone. Ensure `Settings > Developer Options > Advanced Reboot` is toggled to on. Then press the power off button and select `Reboot > Recovery`. From here you will have the new TWRP menu to select `Install` and choose the SuperSu zip file. You will need to swipe right to confirm the Flash.

### One Small Hiccup

I encountered one issue in this process. SuperSu was not intalling from the TWRP menu. I stopped the above process in between Step 2 and Step 3 as I had to go to bed for work the next day. On booting my phone for the day, I let my android install apps associated with my google account. Normally a great feature when signing into a new phone or one that has been formatted. However, the phone must be freshly wiped to be able to install SuperSu. So I had to separately wipe the phone again using the following commands found on this [SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/39357553/3691003):

```bash
$ ./adb reboot bootloader
# Wait a few seconds...

# Check the phone is in bootloader
$ ./fastboot devices
# Wipe user data
$ ./fastboot -w
```
