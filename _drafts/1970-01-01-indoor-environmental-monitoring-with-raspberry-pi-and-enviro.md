Aim: Setup an indoor environmental monitoring, to capture data on volume, gas, pollutants, noice etc

Getting started with a Raspberry Pi Zero W v1.1 - this version includes wireless and bluetooth.

I currently have just the board and power adaptor. There's no way to connect a keyboard or SSH into the RPi at this point. What I need is some essential components:

- 
Storage: SD Card 64gb

- 
Hardware Connectivity: [40-pin male GPIO header](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/male-40-pin-2x20-hat-header?variant=10476117383)

-
